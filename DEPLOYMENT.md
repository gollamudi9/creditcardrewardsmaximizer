# Netlify Deployment Guide

## Current Status
Your project has been prepared for Netlify deployment with:
- ✅ Build configuration updated in `package.json`
- ✅ Netlify configuration file (`netlify.toml`) created
- ✅ Environment variables example (`.env.example`) provided
- ✅ SPA routing redirects (`_redirects`) configured
- ✅ Mock data implementation for analytics and Plaid features
- ✅ Error handling improvements for production

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Your Build Works Locally

First, test that your build process works:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for web
npm run build:web

# Verify the dist folder was created
ls -la dist/
```

### 2. Commit and Push Your Changes

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: prepare for Netlify deployment with mock data and production config"

# Push to your main branch
git push origin main
```

### 3. Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Connect Git Repository (Recommended)

1. **Log in to Netlify**: Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)

2. **Create New Site**: Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"

3. **Connect Git Provider**: Choose your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

4. **Select Repository**: Choose your credit card rewards app repository

5. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build:web`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - **Node version**: `18` (set in Environment variables)

#### Option B: Manual Deploy

If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build:web

# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

In your Netlify dashboard, go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables** and add:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-site-name.netlify.app
EXPO_PUBLIC_PLAID_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
NODE_VERSION=18
```

**Important**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials.

### 5. Verify Deployment

Once deployed, test these features:

#### Core Functionality
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] User authentication (sign up/sign in)
- [ ] Navigation between tabs works
- [ ] No console errors in browser dev tools

#### Analytics Features (Mock Data)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard displays charts and data
- [ ] Forecasting dashboard shows projections
- [ ] Expense planning modal works
- [ ] Alerts center displays notifications

#### Plaid Integration (Mock)
- [ ] Sync screen loads properly
- [ ] Mock Plaid connection flow works
- [ ] Account list displays mock data
- [ ] No hanging on sync operations

### 6. Supabase Database Verification

Ensure your Supabase database is properly configured:

1. **Check Database Schema**:
   - Log into your Supabase dashboard
   - Verify all tables exist (users, credit_cards, transactions, etc.)
   - Confirm RLS policies are enabled

2. **Test Database Connection**:
   - Try signing up for a new account
   - Verify user data is stored in Supabase
   - Check that authentication works end-to-end

3. **Apply Migrations** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # If you have the Supabase CLI installed
   supabase db push
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Node version is 18
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Review build logs in Netlify dashboard

### App Loads but Features Don't Work
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure Supabase URL and keys are valid

### Authentication Issues
- Verify Supabase environment variables
- Check Supabase project settings
- Ensure RLS policies allow user operations

### Sync Hanging Issues
The app now uses mock data for Plaid integration, which should prevent hanging. If issues persist:
- Check browser network tab for failed requests
- Verify error handling is working properly
- Review console logs for JavaScript errors

## Production Considerations

### Security
- Never commit real API keys to Git
- Use Netlify's environment variables for secrets
- Enable HTTPS (automatic with Netlify)

### Performance
- The build is optimized for production
- Static assets are cached automatically
- Consider enabling Netlify's asset optimization

### Monitoring
- Set up Netlify Analytics (optional)
- Monitor build logs for warnings
- Set up error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test thoroughly** on the live site
2. **Share the URL** with stakeholders for feedback
3. **Monitor performance** and user experience
4. **Plan for real Plaid integration** when ready for production banking features

## Support

If you encounter issues:
- Check Netlify's build logs
- Review browser console errors
- Verify Supabase configuration
- Test locally first to isolate issues

Your app is now ready for production deployment with a beautiful, fully-featured interface and mock data that demonstrates all capabilities!
